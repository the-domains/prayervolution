With all the power within me  
Let me return to Love  
Let me walk in the light  
With each step that I take  
Asking for forgiveness whilst always forgiving others  
Let me remember I can only judge all things from my own  
Small and limited experience  
Where 2+2 = not 4  
Why are we all so convicted in our beliefs and frustrations?  
That we must always try to convince others  
When the only thing we know for sure is that we Know nothing at all!  
May we actively seek to take steps towards the light always  
May we be guided  
Hear this heart prayer  
And so be  
Love to all.
