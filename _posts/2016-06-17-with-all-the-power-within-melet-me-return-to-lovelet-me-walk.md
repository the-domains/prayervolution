  With all the power within me  Let me return to Love  Let me walk in the light 
  With each step that I take  Asking for forgiveness whilst always forgiving
  others  Let me remember I can only judge all things from my own small and
  limited experience  Where 2+2 = not 4  Why are we all so convicted in our
  beliefs and frustrations?  That we must always try to convince others  When
  the only thing we know for sure is that we Know nothing at all!  May we
  actively seek to take steps towards the light always  May we be guided  Hear
  this heart prayer  And so be  Love to all

With all the power within me   
Let me return to Love   
Let me walk in the light   
With each step that I take   
Asking for forgiveness whilst always forgiving others   
Let me remember I can only judge all things from my own small and limited experience   
Where 2+2 = not 4   
Why are we all so convicted in our beliefs and frustrations?   
That we must always try to convince others   
When the only thing we know for sure is that we Know nothing at all!   
May we actively seek to take steps towards the light always   
May we be guided   
Hear this heart prayer   
And so be   
Love to all
